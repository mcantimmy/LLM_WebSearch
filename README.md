 # LLM_WebSearch

A tool for enhancing Large Language Models with web search capabilities.

## Overview

This repository contains tools and utilities for integrating web search functionality with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to access up-to-date information from the internet.

## Features

- Web search integration with LLMs: Seamlessly connects Claude 3.7 Sonnet with DuckDuckGo search to provide up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
- Real-time information retrieval: Fetches current information from the web, ranks results by relevance, and extracts meaningful content from webpages
- Enhanced response accuracy with external knowledge: Combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with factual information from the internet to generate comprehensive, accurate answers
- Customizable search parameters: Adjust the number of search results and context sources to balance between depth of information and processing speed
- Follow-up questions generation: Automatically generates potential follow-up questions based on the query and answer, improving the conversation flow
- Self-critique mechanism: Allows the model to critically evaluate its own answers, identifying gaps in knowledge and suggesting improvements
- Contextualized search: Uses the conversation history to refine search queries, ensuring relevant results are retrieved
- Agentic loop: The model decides whether to use web search or not, and if it does, it will generate follow-up questions to further refine the search
